This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The project is an exercise using AI to ask SQL questions based on a given schema. So, the user inputs the schema, asks a question, and the AI will output the SQL query.

The OpenAI integration was done with the [Vercel AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel/ai).

## Getting Started
